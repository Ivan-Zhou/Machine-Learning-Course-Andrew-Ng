    "- Given a data set in which the \"right answers\" were given\n",
    "    - Example: \n",
    "\t\t- Several actual prices for houses of difference size\n",
    "\t\t- Email spam problem\n",
    "\t\t- Classify patients into groups of having diabetes or not\n",
    "\t- Goal: produce more right answers\n",
    "- Regression problem: predict continuous valued output\n",
    "- Classification Question: predict discrete output (0/1, 0/1/2/3)\n",
    "\t- There could be more than one input (feature)\n",
    "\t\t- In the case of Probability of Tumor: Tumor size, age, clump thickness, uniformity of cell shape, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "- Give dataset without clustering or explaining the data, and ask the machine to automatically find structure in the data and cluster individuals into types\n",
    "- Example\n",
    "\t- Given a set of news articles found on the web, group them into set of articles about the same story\n",
    "\t- Given a database of customer data, automatically discover market segments and group customers into different market segments\n",
    "\t- Cocktail Party Problem: in a party with many people and multiple microphone, analyze and identify different sources of recording to separate them\n",
